Hallo 👋🏻,

I am a Software Engineer tired of dealing with sacalability, observability and security issues, so now I'm focused on solving those problems applying DevSecOps practices, SRE and other herbs. I am interested in research and explore emerging technologies, writing books, articles and playing guitar 🤟.

You can see what I am currently up to on [my medium blog](https://diego-rojas.medium.com).
